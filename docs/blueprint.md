- Primary color: Bright purple (#BD93F9) for key elements like the AI's instructions.
- Accent color: Electric green (#50FA7B) to highlight interactive elements and important updates.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for its modern and neutral appearance. Use for both the instructions and any UI text to ensure readability.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent settings, controls, and other app functions.
- A clean, distraction-free layout with the shared screen as the primary focus and instructions presented in a clear, concise manner. Ensure that UI controls are intuitive and out of the way to maximize the user's screen real estate.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during real-time analysis and when presenting new instructions. These should be smooth and non-intrusive.
